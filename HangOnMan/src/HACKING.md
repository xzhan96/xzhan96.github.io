# INITIAL SET UP

To run the build, you'll need to install some node modules.
Run the following in the top-level directory of the project:

    npm install

grunt requires that you install grunt-cli globally
to be able to use grunt from the command line. To install
grunt-cli do:

    npm install -g grunt-cli

You should then install the client-side dependencies into app/lib/:

  ./bower.sh install

Note that if you want to install the application to a Tizen device
as a wgt file, you will also need to install the sdb tool first.
This is available for various platforms from
http://download.tizen.org/tools/latest-release/.

Configure your package manager to use the appropriate repo from the
ones available and install sdb, e.g. for Fedora 17:

    $ REPO=http://download.tizen.org/tools/latest-release/Fedora_17/tools.repo
    $ sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo $REPO
    $ sudo yum install sdb

# WHERE'S THE APP?

There are a few options for running the application:

*   Open app/index.html in a browser (there's no requirement to
    run a build before you can run the app).

*   Serve the app from a standard web server. First, run:

        grunt dist

    Then copy the content of the build/app/ directory to a web folder
    for your server (e.g. an Apache htdocs directory).

*   Run the app using the built-in local server:

        grunt server

    This builds the dist version of the app and runs it on a server
    accessible at http://localhost:30303/. This is useful for testing the
    app in a mobile device: just navigate to the server hosting
    the app, using the phone's browser.

*   Install/reinstall to an attached Tizen device via sdb by running:

        grunt wgt-install

    This installs an optimised version of the app (minified HTML,
    minified and concatenated CSS and JS).

*   Install an SDK-specific version of the app (no minification or
    concatenation) with:

        grunt sdk-install

*   Build the files for the Chrome extension with:

        grunt crx

    then load the build/crx directory as an unpacked extension in Chrome
    developer mode. (The build can't currently make full .crx packages.)

# PACKAGING

To sign the app, grunt needs to know the location of your Tizen SDK
Profile xml file. This is set to default to :

  test:$HOME/tizen-sdk/tools/ide/sample/profiles.xml

which is the default location according to the Tizen CLI SDK instructions
for generating the certificates.

<https://developer.tizen.org/help/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.tizen.web.appprogramming%2Fhtml%2Fide_sdk_tools%2Fcommand_line_interface.htm>

You can override this path using the TIZENSDKPROFILE environment
variable. For example, if you moved the sdk from ~/tizen-sdk to
~/apps/tizen-sdk :

  export TIZENSDKPROFILE=test:$HOME/apps/tizen-sdk/tools/ide/sample/profiles.xml

The application can be packaged into a wgt (zip) file using the grunt
command:

    grunt wgt

This will generate a package in the build/ directory.

It can also be packaged into an SDK wgt file (with uncompressed JS,
CSS, and HTML) using:

    grunt sdk

Note that in both cases, the files comprising the packages are
first copied into the build/wgt and build/sdk directories respectively.
